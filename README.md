# Civic Archipelago
##  Become a civic hero. Build your own pathway to active engagement in your village, town, city, country, and world.
Active citizenship is a state of mind. Your actions and skills can help your communities. Civic engagement should be different for different people, and we need your help to build an inclusive platform to foster civic engagement.
